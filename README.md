# Loading Dot Animation

**Blog Post:** [How To Make A CSS Loading Dot Animation](https://thehelpfultipper.com/how-to-make-a-css-loading-dot-animation/).

Find a detailed walkthrough in the blog post on The Helpful Tipper blog (^_^)

**Objective:**

Build a CSS loading animation of three animated dots in this step-by-step guide.

Our loading animation is inspired by [Oleg Frolov's Loading XXI design animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/5331825-Loading-XXI) over on dribbble. We like the minimalist yet classy aesthetic which does a marvelous job communicating to a user their screen is loading.

We'll be using three animation effects:
- grow effect
- slide effect
- slide and drop effect
